## Introduction

This dashboard was designed for **Job Seekers**, **Career Changers**, and **Professionals** exploring new opportunities to address a common challenge: data job market information is often scattered and difficult to interpret. By leveraging a real-world dataset of 2024 data science job postings (covering job titles, salaries, and locations), the project delivers a clear and interactive platform to explore industry trends and compensation insights.
